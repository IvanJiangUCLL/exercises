# Write your code here
def rotate(xs, n):
    n = n % len(xs)
    xs[:] = xs[n:] + xs[:n]
    return xs

# This Python function rotate takes two parameters: a list xs and an integer n. It rotates the elements in the list xs by n places. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

# n = n % len(xs): This line calculates the remainder of n divided by the length of xs. This is useful when n is larger than the length of xs, as it effectively "wraps around" the list.

# xs[:] = xs[n:] + xs[:n]: This line performs the rotation. xs[n:] gets the sublist of xs from index n to the end, and xs[:n] gets the sublist from the start to n. By concatenating these two sublists, we effectively rotate the list by n places. The xs[:] on the left side of the assignment ensures that the original list xs is modified.

# return xs: Finally, the function returns the modified list.
